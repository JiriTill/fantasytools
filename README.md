# FantasyTools

**FantasyTools** is a web app designed to help worldbuilders, writers, and tabletop RPG creators generate names and ideas for their fictional universes.  
It includes multiple AI-powered generators for characters, worlds, factions, religions, items, and dynamic story elements.

Users select attributes (like race, culture, or magic type), and the app generates ten unique name suggestions based on their input.  
Each name can be saved, submitted to the community gallery, and voted on by others. The homepage showcases the top and newest names from the community.

The project aims to empower creative people with faster inspiration and better tools for building immersive fantasy worlds.  
Whether you're writing a novel, running a campaign, or building a game — FantasyTools makes your imagination easier to organize and share.
